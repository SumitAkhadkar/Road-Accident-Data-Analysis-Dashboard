# Road Accident Data Analysis Dashboard


## Overview

This repository contains the data for creating a road accident data analysis dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide insights into road accidents, including total casualties, casualty percentages by accident severity, the maximum casualties by type of vehicle, casualties by vehicle type, monthly trends, casualties by road type, casualties by light condition, casualties by road surface, and more.

## Requirements

To run and use this dashboard, you'll need the following:

1. Microsoft Excel (2016 or later) with Power Query and Power Pivot add-ins enabled.
2. The provided road accident dataset for the years 2021 and 2022 (`Road Accident Data.xlsx`).
3. Basic knowledge of Excel data analysis and pivot tables.

## Dashboard Components
